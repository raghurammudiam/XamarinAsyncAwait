# XamarinAsyncAwait

1) Developed on windows using VS2019.
2) There are two buttons on the top - "Normal Button" and "Async Button"
3) Both buttons, when clicked, writes a text into the list view below it.
4) Normal Button writes text immediately but Async button writes text only after 10 seconds after the button is clicked
5) Notice how the app let's you click the Normal button even when the Async button is clicked and the system is awaiting a response
